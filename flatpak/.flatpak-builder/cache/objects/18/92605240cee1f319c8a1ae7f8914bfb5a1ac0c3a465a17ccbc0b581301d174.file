	- PostScript output had an extraneous '%' character on the first line,
	which would cause printing to fail.
	- Text handling, during both sizing and layout, incorrectly handled
	empty lines such as label="\nabc".
	- HTML-like tables had been changed to use too much vertical space,
	to possibly use the wrong font in calculating the height of a line,
	and to use the wrong offset when moving the baseline from one line to
	the next.
November 27, 2006
	- release 2.10
	- dot - New pango+cairo renderer plugin (was in separate graphviz-cairo tree).
	  -- -Tpng now uses cairo   (-Tpng:gd for old gd based renderer)
	  -- -Tpdf now available
	  -- -Tps:cairo now available (-Tps is a direct ps renderer not based on cairo)
	  -- -Tsvg:cairo now available (-Tsvg is a direct svg renderer not based on cairo)
	  -- -Txlib now available -- "dot -Tx11 foo.dot"  watches foo.dot with inotify and updates
	  -- -Tgtk now available -- eventually to provide a graph editing capability - not fully working
	  -- -Tswf "Flash" now available using the ming library. Currently has incomplete font support and not yet in Fedora rpms because ming not yet available as rpm.
	- remove hard gd dependencies from dot.  gd renderers now provided
	  as optional plugin.   Deprecated, but required for -Tjpg, -Tgif and -Tvrml.

	- dot - Implement esep attribute to allow graph to specify room
	around nodes for spline routing.

	from codegens to a "core" plugin.
	- dot - new usershape plugin mechanism potentially supporting
	  a wider range of input shape format -> output format combinations.
	display on changes
	- Fixes for builds on Mac OS/X
	- dot - new -O switch to automatically generate output file
	names based on the input filename and the -T value.
	 e.g.  "dot -Tpng -O *.dot"   
	Also works for case of multiple graphs in a single input file.
	- add support for "Brewer" color nameset
	- move reusable .so libraries to $PREFIX/lib per frequent request
	from Debian community.   Plugin .so's remain in $PREFIX/lib/graphviz.

February 3, 2006
	- release 2.8
	- (POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY) The default input scaling, in the
	absence of a "-s" switch, has been changed from inches to points.
	The new behavior of "neato" is equivalent to "neato -s72".
	The old behavior can be restored with "neato -s1".
	The purpose of this change is to avoid a Frequently-Made-Mistake
	when using "neato -n" to process a previously generated layout.
	Previously it was necessary to use "neato -n -s72", but with this
	change the default matches dot's output and the "-s72" is not required.

    NEW FEATURES

    Added a collection of graph processing tools:

    acyclic : a filter that takes a directed graph as input
    and outputs a copy of the graph with sufficient edges
    reversed to make the graph acyclic.

    ccomps : decomposes graphs into their connected components,
    printing the components to standard output.

    colorize : is a filter that sets node colors from initial
    seed values. Colors flow along edges from tail to head.

    gc : a graph analogue to wc in that it prints to standard
    output the number of nodes, edges, connected components or
    clusters contained in the input files.

    gpr : a graph stream editor inspired by awk. It copies
    input graphs to its output, possibly transforming their
    structure and attributes, creating new graphs, or
    printing arbitrary information.

    nop : reads a stream of graphs and prints each in
    pretty-printed (canonical) format on stdout.

    sccmap : decomposes digraphs into strongly connected components
    and an auxiliary map of the relationship between components.

    tred : computes the transitive reduction of directed graphs,
    and prints the resulting graphs to standard output. This
    removes edges implied by transitivity.

    unflatten : is a preprocessor to dot that is used to improve
    the aspect ratio of graphs having many leaves or disconnected
    nodes. The usual layout for such a graph is generally very
    wide or tall. unflatten inserts invisible edges or adjusts
    the minlen on edges to improve layout compaction.


    FIXES

    Add FAQ

    Change PNG default background color from transparent to white
    because of the difficulty some viewers have with transparency.

    Add support for [color=transparent]

    Fix broken support for specific capitalized fontnames
    (Times Helvetica Arial Courier) 

    Fix broken support for DOTFONTPATH

    Some bitmap font scaling fixes - we're still not happy with
    bitmap font scaling as some labels still exceed the area
    allocated by the layout engines.

    Some -Timap fixes for mouse sensitive graphs on web pages

    Some cluster layout fixes

    Fix for [rankdir=LR] problems when using neato layout engine

    Some neato layout fixes
